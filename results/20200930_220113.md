# Idea
Read the word red printed in blue ink and respond to the ink color (blue).

Word reading interferes with color naming because reading is a heavily trained ability that occurs almost automatically and, therefore, is difficult to suppress. 

People are slower when the ink color is inconsistent or incongruent with the word (i.e., incongruent trials) relative to when the ink color and word are congruent or consistent. This effect is known as the Stroop interference effect or the Stroop effect Stroop 1935 studies of interference in serial verbal reactions. 

Test A and B are congruent and incongruent trials respectively (source: [test brain](https://visitcore.com/test-your-brain-the-stroop-test/))
